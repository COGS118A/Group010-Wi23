    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

    "# Abstract \n",
    "In this age, music has become an important part of people’s lives and an incredibly important part of their individuality, so why are our music recommendation systems based on the data from other users? Our research focuses on Spotify, a popular Swedish music service. Spotify currently uses other users' data to suggest songs to users with similar music tastes. We want to create a new algorithm that would focus on the content and composition of songs to recommend objectively similar songs to users. This algorithm could be extended in order to take in any song, form any music platform, and find a similar song within Spotify's database. We plan to utilize K-nearest neighbors in order to find similar songs based on a variety of features, such as key signature. The success of our algorithm will be determined by the objective similarity between songs. Additionally, the researchers will listen to both songs and determine if they are similar, but this data would have little external validity. Further research could be done to increase this validity and evaluate whether the algorithm would have better performance if actually implemented."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "A plethora of research has gone into recommendation algorithms, picking apart every pro and con of the incredibly common mechanism. Research into these algorithms doesn’t converge to provide one technique as the most effective or efficient. Our research plans to specifically place emphasis on Spotify, the incredibly popular Swedish music service. Spotify’s current algorithm pulls from other users data to compare what users with similar music preferences listen to. This recommendation system is called “collaborative filtering”. “If user A has enjoyed songs X, Y and Z, and user B has enjoyed songs X and Y (but haven't heard Z yet), we should recommend song Z to them.” Whether or not someone has “enjoyed” listening to a song is determined by their interactions with it. In Spotify's algorithm, listening to a song for more than 30 seconds is considered enjoying the song. Additionally, they also look at what songs users are ‘liking’ and adding to their playlists (2)\n",
    "This algorithm greatly relies on spotify’s ability to gather data from their customers, which is incredibly expensive and could be considered a breach of privacy on behalf of their customers.(2) The latter doesn’t tend to e a point a contention among spotify customers, since their data is later packaged to them in the form of a yearly recap. Another issue is that the algorithm lacks the ability to adapt to new music and makes it difficult for new artists to break out.(3)  This problem similarly extends to new spotify users who have little data for the algorithm to pull from for its recommendation. This issue would likely still be present in our proposed system, since all recommendation algorithms will have to utilize some kind of user data.\n",
    "Instead, if we could create a new algorithm that focused on the content of songs, we may be able to use machine learning to create a cheaper, better system. This system would focus on quantifying different aspects of songs and finding similar songs to recommend to users. We have chosen our style of recommendation system in hopes that it can be further applied to take input data from outside sources. In theory, any music, from other sites, such as youtube, could be fed into the algorithm, and based on the aspects of the song, the algorithm could provide a recommendation from spotify’s database of songs.

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "As we stated above, the current song recommendation doesn’t objectively rely on the similarity of the songs but similar users’ listening patterns. The purpose of our project is to identify the most similar songs to the current song the user is listening to, hence creating a better recommendation algorithm for spotify recommended songs. We will focus on more technical features of the song itself instead of a similar user’s listening pattern. Our objective is to find the best regression algorithm which generates the most similar songs through the features we provide to it. "
